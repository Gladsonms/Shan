  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <h3>Who are we</h3>
  <p>Sports Warehouse has a long history in sports retail stretching back to the 1970’s.  Through the rise and fall of the traditional sports store, SW has stood its ground and grown up with the community around it, always adapting and staying relevant.</p>
  <p>To date, we are based in the regional areas, because it is what we know and love. Each Sports Warehouse is immersed into the community and we do everything we can to provide locals with expert knowledge, market leading products and service that makes a customer for life. We have evolved to be more than bricks and mortar – our digital presence, ecommerce and online platform push us to keep providing more.</p>
  <p>We are passionate about sports and fitness and we know how good it feels to be active, we are sports people ourselves! Our vision is to build Sports Warehouse into a national sports and fitness retail operation – we want to provide our specialist service to communities across regional Australia. We are welcoming a new generation to join as franchise partners and help us to build this vision.</p>
  <h3>Our philosophy</h3>
  <p>For most people, life is a juggling act full of competing priorities and distractions. The benefits of physical activity are often put aside and we forget how good it feels to be active.</p>
  <p>Sports Warehouse presents a compelling range of branded products and information to inspire sporting and fitness endeavours in an easy, one stop, and well laid-out shopping environment with the purpose of helping you feel good through physical activity.</p>
  <p>No matter what your activity, we are here to help you <b>"Chase the Feeling!"</b></p>
